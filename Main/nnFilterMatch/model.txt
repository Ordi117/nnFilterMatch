## ðŸ”Ž About this Repository

This project is **built on top of the nnU-Net v2 framework** (Isensee et al., *Nature Methods*, 2021).  
Because of that, you will see many of the same components, model structures, and training procedures here  
as in the original [nnU-Net](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) repository.  

To fully use this work, please also download and set up the official **nnU-Net v2** framework,  
as it provides the core functionality that this project extends.
