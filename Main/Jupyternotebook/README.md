## 📓 Notebook Version

For convenience, we provide a **Jupyter Notebook version** of **nnFilterMatch** in this repository.  
This allows you to quickly try out the framework without setting up the full training pipeline.

### ⚙️ Requirements
Before running the notebook, please make sure you have **[nnU-Net](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet)** installed:

```bash
pip install nnunetv2
